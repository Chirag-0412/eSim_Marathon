##  Project Overview

This project presents the design, simulation, and DC analysis of a **single-stage CMOS differential amplifier**  
featuring a complementary rail-to-rail input stage and a PMOS active load.  
It was implemented and simulated using **180nm CMOS technology models**.

The design achieves:
- A wide input common-mode range  
- Symmetrical differential pair configuration (perfect matching)  
- Linear output swing between approximately **0.70 V and 0.82 V**
